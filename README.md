# QuestToDo
QuestToDo is a web app where you can create... TODOS!

QuestTodo is a web that is not like a casual todo(right now it is but you got the point)...It is an app where you can create QUEST! QuestTodo it is based on a fantasy world where you create quest instead of boring tasks! in future functionalities i've planned to add for example, when you crate a new task, an boss appear, so the more task you have uncompleted, the more health the boss it will have
and the more tasks you complete the less health will have! with some basic animations or colors added. 

of course, this project was made during the course of introduction to react js by platzi! this 4 days i've learned a lot about react js, i still need to learn a lot ut it was fun(an stressful too!) C:
